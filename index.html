        <p>
          Hi, I'm Isaac Kobby Anni, a passionate Data Scientist with expertise in machine learning, data analytics, and artificial intelligence. Currently pursuing a PhD in Data Science at Bowling Green State University, I specialize in building predictive models, analyzing complex datasets, and delivering actionable insights to drive decision-making.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a strong academic background in Data Science, Statistics, and Finance, I have hands-on experience in advanced analytics, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and geospatial data analysis. My professional journey includes roles as a Graduate Assistant at Bowling Green State University, where I developed predictive models for student success, and as a Data Science Fellow at ICRISAT/CLU, where I contributed to crop simulation and sentiment analysis projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am proficient in Python, R, SQL, and tools like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and PowerBI. My work focuses on leveraging data to solve real-world problems, from improving loan approval accuracy to identifying potato diseases using deep learning. I am always eager to collaborate on innovative projects and explore new opportunities in data science and AI.
